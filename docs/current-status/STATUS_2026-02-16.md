# Status: 2026-02-16 — Project Bootstrap

## Milestone

Project scaffolded. Monorepo structure, tooling, documentation tree, and architecture docs all in place. Ready to begin Phase 0 implementation.

## What Was Done

- Monorepo initialized (pnpm workspaces, TypeScript strict, Vitest, Prettier)
- Two packages scaffolded: `@opendockit/core` and `@opendockit/pptx`
- Architecture documents finalized:
  - Multi-format OOXML renderer architecture (core + pptx + docx + xlsx)
  - Detailed PPTX SlideKit renderer design
- Full documentation tree created (architecture, specs, testing, plans, status)
- Agent workflow docs (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, QUICKCONTEXT.md, TODO.md, KNOWN_ISSUES.md)

## What's Next

Phase 0 — Core Foundation:

1. OPC Package Reader (JSZip wrapper, lazy extraction, progress)
2. XML parser wrapper (fast-xml-parser + namespace support)
3. Unit conversions (EMU, DXA, half-points)
4. IR type definitions
5. Theme parser + color resolver
6. Font resolver

## Blockers

None.
